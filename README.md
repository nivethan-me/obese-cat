## Why
 Setting up a React app and running is a time consuming task & making decision with React is even harder, what folder structure to go for ? which library to use for routing? which one for writing css? these are hard questions i faced when working with React. over the time i gained bit of knowledge from my work so I created this template which takes all the hard decisions for you on your behalf. Feel free to tweak these template according to your needs.

## Inspirations
